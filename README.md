📂 Repository Structure
File names follow a unit-based naming pattern:

practical1.*.html → Files related to Unit 1 (basic HTML/CSS/JS concepts).

practical2.*.html → Files related to Unit 2 (forms, validation, basic JS logic).

practical3.*.html → Files related to Unit 3 (DOM manipulation, events, dynamic content).

practical4.*.html → Files related to Unit 4 (advanced DOM, canvas, interactivity).

This makes it easy to find all practicals for a specific unit by checking the file name prefix.

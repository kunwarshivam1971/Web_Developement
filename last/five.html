  <h1>How a Mobile Shop Website Works on the Internet</h1>

  <h2>1. Working of the website</h2>
  <p>
    When a customer types <strong>www.durgmobileshop.com</strong> in the browser,
    the Domain Name System (DNS) works like an Internet phone book and converts
    the domain name into the IP address of the web server where the mobile shop
    website is stored.
  </p>
  <p>
    After DNS finds the IP address, the browser sends an HTTP request to that
    server asking for the homepage of the shop. The server replies with HTML,
    CSS and JavaScript files. The browser reads these files and displays the
    page: a list of mobile phones, images, prices and “Add to Cart” buttons.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the user clicks links or buttons, the browser may send more requests to
    the server, or JavaScript can update the page directly using the DOM.
    For example, clicking “View Details” shows extra information about one
    phone, and clicking “Add to Cart” updates the cart section with the selected
    mobile and total price.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Hosting the mobile shop website online</h2>
  <p>
    First the developer creates the website files (such as <em>index.html</em>,
    <em>style.css</em> and <em>script.js</em>) on the local computer and tests
    the site in a browser. To make it public, these files are uploaded to a
    web hosting service. For a simple static mobile shop, free hosting like
    GitHub Pages or Netlify can be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    On GitHub Pages the steps are: create a repository, upload the mobile shop
    files, keep the main file name as <em>index.html</em>, and enable GitHub
    Pages in the repository settings. GitHub then gives a public URL such as
    <em>https://username.github.io/mobile-shop/</em>, and anyone with Internet
    access can open the shop on mobile phones or laptops using that link.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a commercial shop with real payments, the site can be hosted on a
    professional web server. The shop owner registers a custom domain name,
    points the domain's DNS records to the hosting server, and enables HTTPS
    with an SSL certificate so that customer data is encrypted and secure while
    buying mobiles online.
